    <h1>Hobbies I enjoy</h1>
    <h2>Gokart Racing</h2>
    <p>I raced gokarts for 13 years before heading off to college. Now that I have completed college, I hope to start racing again!</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I enjoy learning coding outside of my job. I have started incorporating it into my job. Both in SharePoint, and low-code or no-code development platform, and using HTML and JS.</p>
